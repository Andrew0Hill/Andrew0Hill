- 📋 Developing NLP methods to extract relevant information from free-text EHR notes
- 🦠 Modeling the spread of COVID-19 and long-term effects of COVID-19 infections (Long COVID)
- 🫁 Building automated pipelines for lung radiomics (CT) imaging data

### ☕ Personal Interests:
- 💻 Programming language design and implementation
- 📈 HPC and distributed computing systems
- 📱 Mobile App development (iOS/Flutter)
