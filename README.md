## About Me

My name is Andrew, and I'm a research software engineer working for [CIDA](https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/research-and-practice/centers-programs/cida) in the Colorado School of Public Health.

I'm passionate about building software, models, and tools that enable high-quality health research, and so far I've been lucky enough to build a career doing just that. 

### Current Work:
-  Conducting analyses of biobank genomic data
-  Developing NLP methods to extract relevant information from free-text EHR notes
-  Modeling the spread of COVID-19 and long-term effects of COVID-19 infections (Long COVID)
-  Building automated pipelines for lung radiomics (CT) imaging data

###  Personal Interests:
-  Programming language design and implementation
-  HPC and distributed computing systems
-  Mobile App development (iOS/Flutter)
-  Tinkering with Guitar/MIDI/audio-related projects
